                <p>Arrive at the airport, check in, go through the security check, look for the gate, wait, go on board and depart. The whole experience before departure in the airport can be divided into several linear steps. Some of the information on the boarding pass is needed in each or the step. Thus, I matched the needed information with the steps and related actions to see the order and hierarchy of the information.</p>
